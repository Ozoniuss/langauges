Here is the link of some public API:

https://api.publicapis.org/entries

Write a program that solves the following tasks:

- The API should return two fields, "count" and "entries". Confirm that the
  number returned by "count" is equal to the number of objects in "entries".
- Confirm that every object returned in the "entries" array has the same keys.
- Find all different categories, and how often each one appears in the list.

When you are asked to "confirm" a condition, you should write some code that
fails or throws an exception if that condition is not met.
